# A-B-testing-on-a-website
For this project, I worked to generate and analyze results of an A/B test for  an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. I helped the company to decide if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
