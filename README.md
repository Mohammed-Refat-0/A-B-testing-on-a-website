# A-B-testing-on-a-website
For this project, I worked to generate and analyze results of an A/B test for  an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.  I helped the company to decide if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. the code is writte using python and several of its statistical libraries.the respiratory contains a .ipynb file named "Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb" which is a save of the Jupyter Notebook used to implement the project, and .csv datsets used in the project, as well as a .html file of the code.
